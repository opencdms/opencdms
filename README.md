## Installation

If you want to install OpenCDMS for production use, please see the instructions at https://docs.opencdms.org/administrator.

To set up containers see install/docker-compose.yaml

If you are just interested in working with the OpenCDMS Python package locally then follow the instructions below.

```
# First use pip to install the `opencdms` command line tool
pip install opencdms

# Then install all dependencies into current environment
opencdms install

```

**Note:** If you are developing locally, it is recommended to create a virtual environment before installing all of the opencdms dependencies, you can do this with the following commands:
```
# Create a venv directory to contain the virtual environment
python3 -m venv venv

# Activate the virtual environment
source ./venv/bin/activate

```
